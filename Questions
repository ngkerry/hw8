a. What line of code waits one and a half seconds?
delay(1500);

b. Why does a resistor need an LED? (You mean, why does an LED need a resistor?)
Resistors help limiting the amount of power an LED receives, because LED’s will draw all the power that’s provided to them. Without a connected resistor, the LED would receive too much power and burn out. 

c. Why is a breadboard useful?
The breadboard facilitates the process of building circuits by allowing you to connect wires without having to solder.

d. Identify at least least 2 things you did not understand from the reading
1. What are all the different resistor’s for? 
2. What do all the different colored stripes in the resistors represent?
